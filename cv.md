## About me
29 years old. I want to change my life and become a programmist in JavaScript. I'm not even a Junior now, but I do my best to be Junior in a half year. 
After graduation I worked as a client manager in logistics. Two years ago I braught my dother to the world. So I'm don't working now. It's time for me to learn JavaScript. I like learning. When I began to learn JS I understood that I really missed learning. So I'm really happy today to learn and to believe in myself.
